*Spoiler warning:* Do not look at this repository, if you plan to solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) or [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) by yourself. This repository contains all the solutions I came up with. Most of the code is implemented using [Dart](https://dartlang.org).

None of the code produces actual output, but instead performs assertions that verify that the result is still correct. I focus on short, elegant and fast solutions (in that order). To run all the puzzles from the command line evaluate the following line of code or run the tests.

    dart bin/run.dart
