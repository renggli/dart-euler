*Spoiler warning:* Do not look at this repository, if you plan to solve
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) by yourself. This repository
contains all the solutions I came up with. Most of the code is implemented
using [Dart](https://dartlang.org).

None of the code produces actual output, but instead performs a single
assertion that verifies that the result is still correct. I focus on
short, elegant and fast solutions. To run all the puzzles from the command
line evaluate the following line of code or run the tests.

    dart lib/euler.dart
