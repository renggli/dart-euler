/// Problem 27: Quadratic primes
///
/// Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:
///
///    n^2 + n + 41
///
/// It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
/// values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40 * (40 + 1) +
/// 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly
/// divisible by 41.
///
/// Using computers, the incredible formula n^2 - 79n + 1601 was discovered,
/// which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The
/// product of the coefficients, 79 and 1601, is 126479.
///
/// Considering quadratics of the form:
///
///    n^2 + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
///
/// where |x| is the modulus/absolute value of x e.g. |11| = 11 and |4| = 4.
///
/// Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression
/// that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n,
/// starting with n = 0.
