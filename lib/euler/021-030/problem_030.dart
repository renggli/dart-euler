/// Problem 30: Digit fifth powers
///
/// Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the
/// sum of fourth powers of their digits:
///
///    1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
///    8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
///    9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
///
/// As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.
///
/// The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
///
/// Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of
/// fifth powers of their digits.
