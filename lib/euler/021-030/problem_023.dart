// Problem 23: Non-abundant sums
//
// A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
// exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors
// of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect
// number.
//
// A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
// than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
//
// As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest
// number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By
// mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123
// can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit
// cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the
// greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers
// is less than this limit.
//
// Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum
// of two abundant numbers.
