/// Problem 44: Pentagon numbers
///
/// Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula
///
///   P_n = n * (3 * n - 1) ~/ 2.
///
/// The first 10 pentagonal numbers are:
///
///   1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
///
/// It can be seen that P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8. However, their
/// difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.
///
/// Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P_j and P_k, for which their sum and
/// difference are pentagonal and D = | Pk - Pj | is minimised; what is the
/// value of D?
